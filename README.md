## 💻 C Overview

![C language image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/C_Logo.png)

**C** is a powerful, general-purpose programming language that provides a foundation for many modern languages. Known for its **efficiency** and **control**, C is commonly used in system programming, embedded development, and operating systems.

This repository includes structured C programs organized by concept, making it ideal for learning or quick reference.

## 🚀 Real-World Applications

Due to its ability to directly interact with hardware and memory, C is the backbone of modern computing. Here are its primary applications:

* **Operating Systems:** C is the language of choice for writing OS kernels (including **Linux**, **Unix**, and **Windows**) because it provides low-level access to memory and efficient hardware addressing.
* **Embedded Systems:** From microwave ovens to Mars rovers, C is used in microcontrollers and IoT devices where resources (RAM/CPU) are limited and performance is critical.
* **Database Systems:** High-performance databases like **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Oracle** are written in C to ensure rapid data retrieval and transaction handling.
* **Compilers and Interpreters:** Many modern languages are actually built on top of C. For example, the standard Python implementation (**CPython**) is written in C.
* **Graphics and Gaming:** C (and its successor C++) is used in game engines and high-performance graphics libraries (like **OpenGL**) where rendering speed is paramount.

## ⚙️ Setting up a C Compiler

To compile and run C programs on your computer, you need a C compiler such as **GCC** or **Clang**.

1.  Visit the [GCC official installation page](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/).
2.  Install GCC via your package manager or IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code).
3.  After installation, verify by running this command in Terminal:

    ```bash
    gcc --version
    ```

4.  Now you are ready to write, compile, and execute C programs.
